# Supabase-Table-Type-Definitions-In-Python
Quick implementation of autogenerating type definitions for Supabase tables in Python.

The equivalent command for Node projects is "npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id \"<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>\" > <YOUR_FILE_PATH (ending in .ts)>"

Far from a comprehensive implementation, but this works. PRs and other contributions are welcome.

First, check this issue log to see if Supabase has already implemented their own solution: https://github.com/supabase/postgres-meta/issues/795
